The provided news snippets offer little to no direct information about the Indian developer sector.  To analyze the Indian dev sector, we need news specifically related to India's technology industry, software development, IT outsourcing, and related economic indicators.  The snippets provided focus on US-South Korea trade, Trump's past associates, and fireflies.  These are unrelated to the Indian dev sector.
